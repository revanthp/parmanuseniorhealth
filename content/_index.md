This web site viz., PARAMANUSENIORSHEALTH.ORG has been created to make pensioners and the family of CHSS (Contributory Health Services Scheme) beneficiaries of DAE (Department of Atomic Energy) feel part of a larger network they were otherwise used to during their 3 to 4 decades of active and productive lives they led. The site is designed to be the ultimate and a single stop for all the information needs of senior citizens in DAE. Further, a good amount of information is compiled which even the working employees find it highly useful, thus enabling smooth transition for them from active service to retired life.

Every effort is made to cater specifically to the day to day requirements and quest for vast worldly knowledge matching with the intellectual appetite and calibre of DAE fraternity.
