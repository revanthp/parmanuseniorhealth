## Our Mission

The needs of Pensioners and CHSS beneficiaries can't be felt better than those who were part of the system. Dr. Venu Babu, having lived abroad early on in life for four and half years in the west, with foresight and vision equally for the Netizens and Citizens and Smt. Parvathy with in-depth knowledge and practical experience in operations as Head of Administrative Units across hierarchy in DAE, have forged talent and thoughts to bring out this website with the motto of Social Service and Welfare of the needy.

## Our Purpose

- This site has been created as it has been felt that Pensioners and Beneficiaries of Contributory Health Services Scheme (CHSS) of DAE (Department of Atomic Energy) often feel left out of the system, which they had been part of for nearly three to four decades during the active phase of their life.

- After a period of serious discussion between us and the prospects of limited help from others, we still have decided to persist on the idea of doing something for the community and also help the system in disseminating the information through a public domain.

- This site is named as PARAMANUSENIORSHEALTH.ORG by joining the words Paramanu to represent our affiliation with DAE, Seniors to represent Pensioners and Health to encompass the matters pertaining to Contributory Health Services Scheme (CHSS), for use and the benefit of all Pensioners and CHSS Beneficiaries under DAE. We chose ORG to represent it as a self help group.

- Retirees from different units of DAE are settled and scattered all over the country. In Mumbai CHSS comes under the administrative purview of BARC and Director BARC is the final authority.

- CHSS administers health benefits to the eligible members of DAE fraternity through BARC Hospital along with 16 dispensaries located at various places in Mumbai, Navi Mumbai and the Suburbs.

- This site, as on today, is designed to cater to the needs of all Pensioners and particularly CHSS Beneficiaries residing in Mumbai, Navi Mumbai and the Suburbs.

- Similarly all matters pertaining to Pension are also included with the particulars of prevailing DA, Family Pension, submitting annual Life Certificate, Pension Adalats etc.

- The frame work is made in such a way to serve as a single stop for all the information needs of pensioners and their dependants with respect to health, welfare and day to day needs.

- Another noble cause to be served through this platform is dissemination of information about Hospitals and Medical Establishments in the country that do charity work and offer free treatment.

- Every effort is made to cater specifically to the day to day requirements and quest for vast worldly knowledge matching with the intellectual appetite and calibre of DAE fraternity.

- We are thankful to Mr. M.V. Jyothish Babu for providing constant and valuable help in crystallizing our thoughts into a web site for the benefit of DAE fraternity.

- Visitors are requested to give their valuable feed back to improve the content. Opinions and experiences received as emails will be posted under blogs section after moderation, if needed.
